 CSA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After years of threats and compromises 7 southern American States have seceded from the old Union and declared the Confederate States of America. Under a strong secessionist fever more slave states are on the verge of joining the Confederacy poised to gain independence. But outside the walls of Montgomery Alabama the cruel realization of whats to happen is seen by few, the South lacks the industrial might of the North and requires large amounts of exports to keep itself alive. If the South is to win the coming Civil War they must force Europe's hand to intervene and maintain their supply of King Cotton."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The British Empire stands tall, with the Industrial Revolution at near full throttle in England the British are by far the most powerful country in the world. The British have led and successfully put the Chinese under their feet with the success of the two Opium Wars which saw the expansion of the British Economical influence grow and expand. But the American problems have opened a gateway for the British to expand their influence, if the Empire is to support the Confederate States win the war it will not only damage the United States greatly but could allow British taking of it´s former colonies, but if the South is to lose their is  no telling who might be the next victim. Great Britain holds many cards on it´s hand but playing too much might counter fire."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the defeat of Napoleon 50 years before the French have regained their power, after the return of Bonaparte to France, the French are very strong. Their ambitions throughout the world are only rivalñed by those of the British. But the French have several things to worry about, to the east Prussia is making gain on it´s drive to unite the German States, the Radical Fever has caught fire mainly in France opening up to dangerous Radicalist ideals. The French have more to lose than gain in America but if they along with the British play their cards right they both might as well reclaim their American territories."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Soviet Union is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
